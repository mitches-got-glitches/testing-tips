# Marp Action for GitHub

Presentations to Webpages: Instantly!

## What?

[Marp](https://marp.app/) lets you create slides from markdown (like this!).

[Marp Action](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/marp-action) lets you automatically deploy your presentation to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This presentation is both a [website](https://alexsci.com/test-marp-action) and a [README.md](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/test-marp-action/blob/dev/README.md).

## Why?

Treat your presentation the same way you treat code.

Use git to track changes. Pull requests to collaborate. Deploy to a webpage automatically.

See a bug? Open an issue or pull request!

## Setup

Want to create your own?

First, create a new repo [from the template repo](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/test-marp-action).

## Configure GitHub Pages

[Setup publishing](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).

Remember the branch and URL shown.

## Update Workflow

You'll update the workflow file over the next few slides. You can do this right in the GitHub web page (click on the pencil icon).

`.github/workflows/main.yml`

## `BASE_URL`

Set this to the domain you're using for GitHub Page (from earlier).

If you add a custom domain later, you'll need to update this.

## `PUBLISH_TO_BRANCH`

Tell the build which branch you are using for GitHub Pages (you picked this earlier).

This is likely either `master` or `gh-pages`. Set `PUBLISH_TO_BRANCH` to the correct branch.

## Update Workflow

Commit `.github/workflows/main.yml` back to `dev` branch.

This will kick off a build.

## Check if the build succeeded

Click on Actions tab and see if the build succeeded.

## Load your new web page

Any update to your site will take a few minutes to be visible. Be patient.

## Create your slides

Finally, start adding your own content.

You can [install and run marp-cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/blob/master/README.md) locally to test out the content before publishing.
